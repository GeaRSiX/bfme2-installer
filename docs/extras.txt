Widescreen Camera Fix
http://www.wsgf.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=16029

Notes:
The game will run fine in widescreen, this mod basically fixes the camera so that it's more zoomed out (the default camera is designed for 4:3 screens).
It's important to note that running this might stop you being able to access the multiplayer because the game will detect the .exe as invalid.
